# Stacey 3.0.0

## Overview
Stacey takes content from `.yml` files, image files and implied directory structure and generates a website.
It is a no-database, dynamic website generator.

If you look in the `/content` and `/templates` folders, you should get the general idea of how it all works.

## Installation

Copy to server, `chmod 777 app/_cache`.

If you want clean urls, `mv htaccess .htaccess`

## Templates

Stacey uses the [Twig templating language](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/).

There are an additional two sets of templates which can be found at:
<http://github.com/kolber/stacey-template2> &
<http://github.com/kolber/stacey-template3>
